# MacOS app

## Getting Started

To enable MacOS support on your machine:
1. Run `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop` in the root folder of the app.
2. Restart your IDE
3. A device named "macOS (desktop)" should now be visible in e.g. IntelliJ.
4. Or use `flutter run -d macOS` to run on MacOS
5. Enjoy!
